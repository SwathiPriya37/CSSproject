        <h1 style="text-align: center;">About Us</h1>
        <p>Perfume is not just a product; it is an art form deeply rooted in history and culture. The origins of perfume trace back to ancient civilizations such as Egypt, Mesopotamia, and India, where it was used in religious rituals, personal adornment, and even medicine. Over time, perfume evolved from being a luxury for the elite to a widely accessible commodity.The creation of perfume begins with sourcing ingredients, which may include flowers, fruits, spices, woods, and animal-derived substances, as well as synthetic compounds. Perfumers, often called "noses," use their expertise to design complex blends that evoke specific moods,emotions or feelings.</p>
